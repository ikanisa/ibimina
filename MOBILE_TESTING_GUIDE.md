# Mobile Device Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the SACCO+ Client App
on real Android and iOS devices.

## Overview

The SACCO+ Client App is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for mobile-first
usage. This guide covers:

- Android device testing
- iOS device testing
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- Performance validation
- Offline functionality verification

---

## Prerequisites

Before testing on mobile devices:

1. **Development Server Running**

   ```bash
   cd apps/client
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Connect mobile device to same Wi-Fi network as development machine
   - Find your local IP address:
     ```bash
     # macOS/Linux
     ifconfig | grep "inet "
     # Windows
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Access app on mobile using: `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3001`

3. **HTTPS for Production Testing**
   - PWA features require HTTPS in production
   - Use ngrok for testing with HTTPS:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 3001
     ```

## Performance Testing

### Tools

1. **Chrome DevTools Device Mode**
   - Simulate mobile devices
   - Throttle network to 3G
   - Check performance metrics

2. **Lighthouse**
   ```bash
   # Run from client app directory
   pnpm run check:lighthouse
   ```

### Key Metrics

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: < 300ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **Speed Index**: < 3.4s

### Load Testing Scenarios

1. **3G Network**
   - Throttle to 3G speed
   - App should load in under 5 seconds
   - Images should lazy load

2. **Slow Device**
   - Use older device (e.g., Android with < 2GB RAM)
   - Check for performance degradation
   - Monitor memory usage

3. **High Latency**
   - Add 1000ms latency in DevTools
   - App should handle gracefully
   - Show loading indicators
