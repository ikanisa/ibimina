# Deployment Readiness Report

## Summary
| App | Status | Key Risks | Time to Green |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Next.js web (`.`) | Amber | Secrets must be populated for Supabase, OpenAI, Resend, and log drain before production hosting; Supabase edge functions must mirror shared secrets. | ~0.5 day once secrets are in place |

## Inventory Highlights
- Package manager: **pnpm** (`pnpm-lock.yaml`), Node engine pinned to `>=18.18.0` with `.nvmrc` (`18.20.4`).
- Framework: **Next.js 15 App Router** with API routes, Supabase integrations, OpenAI OCR, and MFA flows.
- Supporting services: Supabase SQL + Functions (see `supabase/`), optional Twilio/Resend integrations, PWA support via `next-pwa`.
- Build artifact: `.next` with `output: 'standalone'` for self-hosted Node deployments.

## Environment Matrix & Validation
- `audit/env-matrix.csv` inventories every `process.env`/`Deno.env` usage with scope, requirement level, and defaults.
- `.env.example` now documents local runtime defaults (including `APP_ENV`, `PORT`, Supabase secrets) while clarifying server-only vs browser-exposed variables.
- `supabase/.env.example` mirrors shared secrets so the Supabase dashboard stays consistent with the web runtime.
- `src/env.server.ts` validates secrets with Zod at build/start, enforcing Supabase/OpenAI/HMAC/KMS requirements and providing typed helpers for rate-limit/email peppers. Validation errors surface during `pnpm build` and CI.

## Local Hosting Plan
- `next.config.ts` imports the validated env module, keeps `output: 'standalone'`, disables remote image optimisation (`images.unoptimized = true`), and retains PWA bundling toggles for local hosting.
- `/api/healthz` reports status, build ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`/`APP_COMMIT_SHA`), region hint (`APP_REGION`), and timestamp for external monitors or Supabase post-deploy hooks.
- `package.json` scripts standardise on `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm start` (binding `PORT`, default 3000) to match MacBook/local server workflows.

## Build Diagnostics
- Confirmed no edge-specific blockers; all API routes and middleware execute on the Node runtime.
- `.nvmrc` aligns local/CI Node versions.
- Playwright harness injects stub secrets (service role key, HMAC, OpenAI) to satisfy env validation without leaking production credentials.

## CI Alignment
- Added `node.yml` workflow scaffolding (pnpm cache, `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`) to guarantee parity with local MacBook builds.
- Existing `ci.yml` remains the full battery (lint, tests, Playwright, Lighthouse) for release gating.

## Local / Pre-Deploy Guardrails
- Shared required-variable list lives in `config/required-env.json`, preventing drift between validator, scripts, and documentation.
- Developers should copy `.env.example` â†’ `.env.local` (gitignored) and populate Supabase/OpenAI/HMAC secrets before running `pnpm build && pnpm start`.
- `docs/local-hosting.md` (new) walks through MacBook setup, Supabase expectations, and health checks.

## Outstanding Risks & Follow-ups
- **Secrets population**: `.env.local` (web runtime) and Supabase dashboard must define all required env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `BACKUP_PEPPER`, `MFA_*`, `HMAC_SHARED_SECRET`, `KMS_DATA_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).
- **Third-party dependencies**: Twilio, SMTP, and log drain integrations remain optional but should be exercised in staging if enabled.
- **Supabase migrations**: Ensure migrations/functions are deployed and up to date before exposing traffic; this audit did not run database migrations.
- **Observability**: Configure `LOG_DRAIN_URL`/alert webhook before go-live to preserve security audit trail.

## Next Steps Checklist
1. Populate `.env.local` (and any automation scripts) using `.env.example` as the source of truth.
2. Mirror shared secrets in the Supabase dashboard via `supabase/.env.example`.
3. Run `pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm start` on the target MacBook host; verify `/api/healthz` responds with HTTP 200.
4. Execute the full CI pipeline (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, tests) to confirm parity with automation.
5. Configure monitoring/log drain endpoints once the app is accessible behind the intended reverse proxy.
