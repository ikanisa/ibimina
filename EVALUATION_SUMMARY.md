## System Understanding Achieved

### Three Applications Identified and Analyzed

#### 1. Admin/Staff App (`apps/admin`, port 3000)

- **Purpose**: Staff console for SACCO operations
- **Status**: ✅ Mostly production-ready
- **Tech**: Next.js 16.0.0, Supabase, Multi-factor auth
- **Features**: Dashboard, member management, payments, reconciliation,
  reporting
- **Security**: Service role key, MFA (TOTP, Passkeys, Email, Backup codes)
- **Issue**: Has duplicate auth stacks (legacy + AuthX) - needs consolidation

#### 2. Client App (`apps/client`, port 3001)

- **Purpose**: Member-facing Progressive Web App
- **Status**: ⚠️ Needs OCR and mobile testing
- **Tech**: Next.js 15.5.4, Supabase, PWA with service worker
- **Features**: Onboarding, group discovery, payments, profile management
- **Security**: Anon key with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Issues**: OCR is stub only, not tested on mobile devices

#### 3. Platform API (`apps/platform-api`, no HTTP port)

- **Purpose**: Background workers and scheduled jobs
- **Status**: ⚠️ Needs implementation
- **Tech**: Node.js, TypeScript, worker processes
- **Workers**: MoMo poller, GSM heartbeat
- **Security**: Service role key for elevated database access
- **Issue**: Workers are placeholders, need actual implementation

### Access Patterns Documented

| App          | Users   | Auth        | Access Level            | Network                       |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Admin        | Staff   | Email + MFA | Service role (elevated) | Public HTTPS                  |
| Client       | Members | Email only  | Anon key + RLS          | Public HTTPS, offline-capable |
| Platform API | System  | N/A         | Service role (elevated) | Internal (recommended)        |

### Interlinking Mechanism: Supabase-Centric

```
Admin App ──┐
            ├──> Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) <───┐
Client App ─┘                                                            │
                                                                         │
Platform API Workers ────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Communication**:

- All apps use Supabase as central hub
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- No direct app-to-app HTTP communication
- Security enforced via RLS policies and access keys

## Gaps Identified and Prioritized

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix Before Production) - 3 Total

1. **Platform API Workers Not Implemented** [HIGH IMPACT]
   - MoMo poller doesn't actually poll
   - GSM heartbeat doesn't check modem
   - Effort: 1-2 weeks
   - Implementation plan provided with code

2. **Client App OCR is Stub** [HIGH IMPACT]
   - No real OCR service integration
   - Members can't complete identity verification
   - Effort: 1 week
   - Implementation plan includes Google Vision API integration

3. **Admin App Duplicate Auth Stacks** [MEDIUM IMPACT]
   - Legacy `/api/mfa/*` + new `/api/authx/*` both exist
   - Security risk, maintenance burden
   - Effort: 3-5 days
   - Plan: Keep legacy, remove AuthX

### High Priority Gaps - 4 Total

4. Mobile readiness not verified
5. No unified cross-app monitoring
6. Deployment strategy needs documentation (✅ NOW RESOLVED)
7. Environment config scattered

### Medium Priority Gaps - 7 Total

8-14. Feature parity, rate limiting, testing, config management, etc.

## Production Readiness Assessment

| Component       | Status        | Blockers                    |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Admin App Core  | ✅ 90% Ready  | Auth cleanup needed         |
| Client App Core | ⚠️ 60% Ready  | OCR + mobile testing        |
| Platform API    | ❌ 20% Ready  | Workers need implementation |
| Database        | ✅ Ready      | Schemas + RLS in place      |
| Deployment      | ✅ Documented | Guide now available         |
| Monitoring      | ⚠️ 40% Ready  | Needs dashboard             |
| Security        | ✅ 85% Ready  | Auth consolidation needed   |

**Overall System**: ⚠️ **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

- Estimated work to production: 4-6 weeks

## Conclusion

The Ibimina/SACCO+ system has a solid architectural foundation with proper
separation of concerns across three apps. The main blockers to production are:

1. **Platform API workers need implementation** (1-2 weeks)
2. **Client OCR needs real integration** (1 week)
3. **Mobile app needs testing** (1 week)

With the comprehensive documentation now in place, the development team has
clear guidance on:

- How the system works
- What needs to be fixed
- How to fix it
- How to deploy it
- How to monitor it

**Estimated time to production readiness: 4-6 weeks**

All documentation is in the repository root for easy access.
