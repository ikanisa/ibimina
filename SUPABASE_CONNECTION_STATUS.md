# Supabase Connection Status

## Overview
All three applications (Admin PWA, Client PWA, Website) are properly configured to connect to Supabase, but **full database testing requires the 89 SQL migrations to be run first**.

## Environment Configuration ✅

All required Supabase environment variables are configured:

- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Anonymous/public key
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-only)

## Supabase Client Configuration ✅

### Admin App (apps/admin)
- **Browser Client**: `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` - For client components
- **Server Client**: `createSupabaseServerClient()` - For server components/API routes
- **Service Role Client**: `createSupabaseServiceRoleClient()` - For admin operations

### Client App (apps/client)
- **Browser Client**: `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` - For client components
- **Server Client**: `createSupabaseServerClient()` - For server components/API routes

### Configuration Features
- Cookie-based session management with `@supabase/ssr`
- Singleton pattern for browser clients
- Environment variable validation with `requireSupabaseConfig()`
- Proper error handling for missing credentials
- No session persistence for service role clients (correct behavior)

## Application Status ✅

| Application | Port | Status | Supabase Connected |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Admin PWA | 5000 | ✅ Running | ✅ Configured |
| Client PWA | 3000 | ✅ Running | ✅ Configured |
| Website | 3001 | ✅ Running | ✅ Configured |

## Migration Prerequisite ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: The Supabase database schema does not yet exist because the 89 SQL migrations have not been run.

### Why Migrations Must Be Run Locally

1. **Network Limitation**: Replit environment cannot directly connect to Supabase database (IPv6/connectivity issues)
2. **Migration Count**: 89 migrations must be executed in chronological order
3. **Dependency**: All database operations require the schema to exist first

### Migration Files Location
```
supabase/migrations/
├── 20231201000000_initial_schema.sql
├── 20231202000000_add_users.sql
├── ...
└── 20241030000000_latest_migration.sql
```

## Testing After Migrations ✅

Once migrations are complete, test these operations:

### Admin App
- [ ] User login/authentication
- [ ] Ikimina group listing
- [ ] Member management
- [ ] Reconciliation data fetch
- [ ] Dashboard analytics

### Client App  
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] View contributions
- [ ] Loan applications
- [ ] Profile data

### Website
- [ ] SACCO directory listing
- [ ] Public data fetching

## Migration Instructions

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# On your local machine (not Replit)
cd /path/to/ibimina

# Link to your Supabase project
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Run all migrations
npx supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Using psql Directly
```bash
# On your local machine with PostgreSQL client
cd /path/to/ibimina/supabase/migrations

# Run migrations in order
for file in *.sql; do
  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f "$file"
done
```

### Option 3: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy/paste each migration file in chronological order
4. Execute one by one

## Post-Migration Verification

After running migrations, verify the schema exists:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check RLS policies exist  
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Check functions exist
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

## Security Notes

1. **Never expose service role key** - Keep it server-side only
2. **RLS policies required** - All tables must have Row Level Security enabled
3. **Rotate credentials** - User noted credentials were posted in chat and should be rotated before production
4. **Use environment secrets** - All keys stored securely in Replit Secrets

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Supabase connection configuration complete
2. ⏳ Run 89 migrations on Supabase database (user action required locally)
3. ⏳ Test all database operations after migrations
4. ⏳ Verify RLS policies work correctly
5. ⏳ Test authentication flows end-to-end
6. ⏳ Rotate Supabase credentials before production deployment
