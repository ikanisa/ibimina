## FAQs

**Q: Is this app safe to use?**  
A: Yes. The app only accesses mobile money SMS, encrypts all data, and uses
secure HTTPS connections. Full source code is reviewed by security experts.

**Q: Can other apps on my device access my SMS?**  
A: No. Android permissions are app-specific. Only Ibimina Staff can access SMS
if you grant permission.

**Q: What happens if I disable SMS ingestion?**  
A: Background sync stops, no more SMS are read, and you'll need to enter
payments manually.

**Q: Can I use the web version instead?**  
A: Yes, but SMS ingestion only works on the Android app. Web version requires
manual payment entry.

**Q: Is my personal SMS data sent to the server?**  
A: No. Only mobile money SMS from MTN/Airtel are processed. Personal SMS are
never accessed or transmitted.

**Q: How long are my SMS stored?**  
A: SMS text is processed immediately and not stored on your device. Parsed
payment data is stored on secure servers per SACCO record retention policy
(typically 7 years).

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**  
A: Yes, but SMS ingestion should only be enabled on your primary work device to
avoid duplicate payments.

**Q: What if I lose my device?**  
A: Immediately contact your IT administrator to revoke device access. No SMS are
stored locally, so your personal data remains secure.
