# Authentication Copy Guidelines

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Lead with reassurance: "We just need a quick check to keep your account safe."
- Clarify action in one line per factor (e.g., "Enter the 6-digit code from your
  authenticator app").
- Keep factor names consistent: **Passkey**, **Authenticator App**, **Email
  Code**, **WhatsApp Code**, **Backup Code**.
- Remind of timing: show expiry or cooldown in the same sentence as the action.
- For retries, acknowledge progress: "Still not working? Try another factor or
  use a backup code."

## Trusted Devices

- Explain the benefit before the choice: "Trust this device for 30 days so you
  don’t have to verify every time."
- Default to on for personal devices; remind to turn off on shared devices.
- Keep the opt-out short and adjacent: "Uncheck if you’re on a shared or public
  device."
- Confirm when applied: "This device is trusted. We’ll skip extra checks here
  for 30 days."

## Offline and Limited Connectivity

- Surface offline mode early: "You’re offline. Codes from authenticator apps
  still work."
- Offer alternatives: "If SMS/WhatsApp can’t reach you, use an authenticator app
  or backup code."
- Set expectations for delays and retries with exact timing when possible.
- Close with a safe exit: "If you can’t verify right now, sign out and try again
  when you’re connected."
