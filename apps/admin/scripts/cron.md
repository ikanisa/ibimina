# Scheduled Task Guidance

This project previously relied on GitHub Actions cron triggers. Those schedules
have been removed while we refine the automation approach.

## Running scheduled work locally

Use the following options to simulate scheduled jobs until automation returns:

1. **System cron**
   - Register a cron entry that executes the required pnpm script.
   - Example:
     ```cron
     */30 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && pnpm run task-name
     ```
   - Ensure the environment variables required by the script are exported in the
     cron context.

2. **node-cron script**
   - Install `node-cron` as a dev dependency if it is not already available:
     ```bash
     pnpm add -D node-cron
     ```
   - Create a small runner, e.g. `scripts/schedule-runner.mjs`:

     ```js
     import cron from "node-cron";
     import { runTask } from "./task-runner.mjs";

     cron.schedule("0 2 * * *", async () => {
       await runTask();
     });
     ```

   - Launch it locally with `pnpm node scripts/schedule-runner.mjs`.

      requirements are defined.
