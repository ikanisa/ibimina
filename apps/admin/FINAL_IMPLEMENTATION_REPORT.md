## Known Limitations

1. **Platform Support**
   - Android only (iOS cannot access SMS)
   - Requires native app (web has no SMS API)

2. **SMS Providers**
   - MTN and Airtel supported
   - New providers require code update

3. **Background Sync**
   - 15-minute default interval (not real-time)
   - Battery optimization may delay sync
   - Requires network connectivity

4. **Parsing**
   - Regex tuned for current formats
   - Provider changes may break parsing
   - OpenAI fallback for edge cases

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-Term (1-2 months)

- Real-time SMS via broadcast receiver
- Configurable sender whitelist (no code changes)
- In-app update mechanism
- Enhanced analytics

### Long-Term (3-6 months)

- ML-based payment matching
- Multi-language SMS support
- Additional payment provider integrations
- Automated reconciliation reports

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. ⏳ Deploy Supabase Edge Functions (if needed)
3. ⏳ Build release APK
4. ⏳ Test on pilot devices

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. ⏳ Distribute to pilot group (5-10 staff)
2. ⏳ Monitor for issues
3. ⏳ Collect feedback
4. ⏳ Address any bugs

### Medium-Term (1 Month)

1. ⏳ Roll out to all staff devices
2. ⏳ Monitor SMS ingestion health
3. ⏳ Track payment allocation accuracy
4. ⏳ Gather usage metrics

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- ✅ Zero build errors
- ✅ Zero lint warnings
- ✅ Zero type errors
- ✅ Code review passed
- ⏳ <5 seconds SMS → backend (pending test)
- ⏳ >95% parse accuracy (pending production data)

### User Metrics

- ⏳ <1% installation failures (pending rollout)
- ⏳ >90% feature adoption (pending rollout)
- ⏳ <5% user-reported issues (pending rollout)
- ⏳ Positive staff feedback (pending surveys)

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring

- Check `sms_inbox` for `status = 'FAILED'`
- Monitor Edge Function error rates
- Track payment allocation success
- Review crash reports

### Troubleshooting Guides

- SMS not captured → Check permissions, battery, logcat
- Backend errors → Review Edge Function logs, HMAC config
- Parse failures → Check SMS format, OpenAI API, regex
- Sync delays → Verify network, WorkManager constraints

### Update Process

1. Bump version in `build.gradle`
2. Build and sign APK
3. Test on devices
4. Distribute via Firebase/MDM
5. Monitor rollout

---

## Conclusion

The Android SMS ingestion feature is **fully implemented, documented, and ready
for deployment**. All code is production-ready, passes all automated checks, and
includes comprehensive documentation for deployment, testing, and maintenance.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with building the release APK and distributing to a
pilot group of 5-10 staff members for 1-2 weeks of real-world testing before
full rollout.
