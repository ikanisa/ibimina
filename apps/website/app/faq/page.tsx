          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            SACCO+ is a digital intermediation platform for Umurenge SACCOs in Rwanda. We digitize
            ibimina (savings groups) using USSD-first contributions. SACCO+ never handles funds—we
            only issue standardized references and produce allocation-based statements.

            How is SACCO+ different from traditional SACCO software?
          </summary>
          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            Unlike traditional SACCO cores that manage accounts and process transactions, SACCO+ is
            intermediation-only. We don&apos;t integrate with your core banking system. Deposits go
            directly to your MoMo merchant account via USSD. We simply map SMS confirmations to
            member reference tokens and produce statements.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            SACCO+ is designed for Umurenge SACCOs across Rwanda. We&apos;re piloting with Nyamagabe
            District. SACCO staff onboard members and approve all groups. Members contribute via
            USSD and view statements in the mobile app.

          </summary>
          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            No. SACCO+ never handles funds. When you make a USSD payment, your money goes directly
            to your SACCO&apos;s Mobile Money merchant account. SACCO+ only receives SMS
            confirmation notifications to map payments to your reference token.

          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            Yes. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We use Row-Level Security (RLS) to
            ensure you can only see your own data. Phone numbers are hashed. We never store National
            IDs or Mobile Money PINs. Audit logs track all data access.

          <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
            No. Token-scoped RLS policies ensure members can only view their own groups and
            allocations. Even if devices are shared, your reference token is personal and your data
            remains private.

            No! USSD works on any mobile phone. To contribute, just dial *182# from your Mobile
            Money registered number. No data or internet required. The mobile app (for viewing
            statements) is optional and can be accessed as a PWA.

            Use the SIM card registered with your Mobile Money account when dialing USSD. Your phone
            may ask you to select which SIM to use. Choose the one linked to your MoMo account.

            Contact your SACCO staff to be onboarded. You&apos;ll receive a reference token (e.g.,
            NYA.GAS.TWIZ.001). You can also request to join via the mobile app, but staff must

            No problem! Your reference token is personal. As long as you use your own Mobile Money
            account and reference when making USSD payments, your contributions are tracked
            correctly. In the app, token-scoped security ensures you only see your own data.

            USSD works without internet, so yes! As long as you have mobile network coverage, you
            can dial *182# and contribute. The app works offline too (PWA), showing your cached
            statements and reference card.

            No. SACCO+ runs alongside your existing core without integration. Deposits go to your
            MoMo merchant account. We export allocation CSV reports that you can import into your

            Staff can reissue the reference card from the admin app. The token itself doesn&apos;t
            change—it&apos;s tied to the member&apos;s account. Just print a new card with the same
            reference.

            USSD payments still work—they go directly to your MoMo merchant account. The app has
            offline fallback pages showing cached statements and reference cards. SMS ingestion
            resumes when the service recovers, so no payments are lost.
