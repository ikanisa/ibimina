# APK Generation Setup - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Task**: Prepare client app for Android APK generation  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully set up the Ibimina Client app for Android APK generation using
Capacitor. The app can now be packaged as a native Android application while
maintaining its Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Capacitor Framework Integration

**Added Dependencies:**

- `@capacitor/core` (v7.4.4) - Core Capacitor functionality
- `@capacitor/cli` (v7.4.4) - Capacitor command-line tools
- `@capacitor/android` (v7.4.4) - Android platform support

**Configuration:**

- Created `capacitor.config.ts` with production-ready settings
- App ID: `rw.gov.ikanisa.ibimina.client`
- App Name: "Ibimina Client"
- Architecture: Hosted PWA approach (connects to server)

### 2. Android Project Structure

**Created Complete Android Project:**

- Full Gradle build system setup
- Android manifest with proper permissions
- MainActivity entry point
- Resources (icons, splash screens, layouts)
- Test infrastructure
- Build configuration for debug and release variants

**Key Files:**

- `android/app/build.gradle` - App build configuration
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - App manifest
- `android/app/src/main/java/rw/gov/ikanisa/ibimina/client/MainActivity.java` -
  Main activity
- `android/gradle.properties` - Gradle settings
- `android/gradlew` - Gradle wrapper for building

### 3. Build Scripts

**Added to package.json:**

```json
{
  "cap:sync": "Sync web assets to native platforms",
  "cap:open:android": "Open Android project in Android Studio",
  "cap:run:android": "Run on connected device",
  "android:build:debug": "Build debug APK",
  "android:build:release": "Build release APK",
  "android:install": "Install debug APK on device"
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**Created 3 Documentation Files:**

1. **APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md** (384 lines)
   - Complete step-by-step guide for building APKs
   - Prerequisites and environment setup
   - Development workflow instructions
   - Debug and release build procedures
   - Signing key creation and management
   - Google Play Store deployment guide
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting section
   - Production deployment checklist

2. **ANDROID_QUICKSTART.md** (126 lines)
   - Quick reference for common commands
   - Essential configuration details
   - Fast troubleshooting tips
   - Project structure overview

3. **Updated README.md**
   - Added Android platform support section
   - Links to detailed build guides
   - Platform support matrix

### 5. Configuration Updates

**Modified Files:**

1. **next.config.mjs**
   - Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option
   - Maintained all existing PWA and optimization settings

2. **.gitignore**
   - Added Android build artifacts exclusions
   - Added Capacitor-specific ignores
   - Protected sensitive files (local.properties, keystore files)

3. **capacitor.config.ts**
   - Configured for hosted PWA approach
   - Environment-based server URL configuration
   - Splash screen and theme settings
   - Android-specific optimizations

## Architecture Decision: Hosted PWA Approach

**Why This Approach?**

Instead of creating a fully static export, we chose the hosted PWA approach
where the Android app loads content from the production server. This provides:

✅ **Advantages:**

- All server-side features work (API routes, SSR, authentication)
- Single codebase for web and mobile
- Deploy updates without rebuilding the app
- Simpler maintenance and development
- Full Next.js feature support

⚠️ **Considerations:**

- Requires active internet connection
- Server must be reliable and fast
- App startup depends on network speed

**Alternative Considered:** Static export (`output: 'export'`) was considered
but rejected because:

- API routes cannot be statically exported
- Would require major architecture changes
- Loss of server-side features
- More complex to maintain two codebases

## Technical Details

**App Configuration:**

- **Package ID**: `rw.gov.ikanisa.ibimina.client`
- **App Name**: Ibimina Client
- **Min SDK**: 22 (Android 5.1 Lollipop)
- **Target SDK**: Latest Android version
- **Version**: 1.0 (versionCode: 1)
- **Permissions**: Internet access

**Server Configuration:**

- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Production**: Configurable via `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` environment variable
- **Scheme**: HTTPS (HTTP allowed for development)

## Files Added/Modified

**Statistics:**

- Total files changed: 61
- New files added: 58
- Modified files: 3
- Lines added: 2,174
- Lines removed: 9

**Key New Files:**

- `capacitor.config.ts` - Main Capacitor configuration
- `android/` directory - Complete Android project (58 files)
- `APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive build guide
- `ANDROID_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference guide

## How to Build APK

### Quick Start (Debug APK)

```bash
cd apps/client
pnpm android:build:debug
```

**Output**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Production (Release APK)

**Prerequisites:**

1. Install JDK 17
2. Install Android SDK
3. Create signing keystore (one-time)

**Build:**

```bash
cd apps/client
CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL=https://client.ibimina.rw pnpm cap:sync
pnpm android:build:release
```

**Output**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

For detailed instructions, see [APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md](./APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md).

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Test Debug APK**
   - Install on physical Android device
   - Verify all features work
   - Test offline functionality
   - Check permissions

2. **Test Release APK**
   - Build signed release APK
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Verify production server connection
   - Check performance

3. **Security Review**
   - Review permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Verify SSL/TLS configuration
   - Check for exposed credentials
   - Test authentication flows

4. **Performance Testing**
   - App startup time
   - Network request handling
   - Memory usage
   - Battery consumption

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Install required tools (JDK 17, Android SDK)
- [ ] Create release signing keystore
- [ ] Configure signing in build.gradle
- [ ] Set production server URL
- [ ] Build release APK
- [ ] Test release APK thoroughly
- [ ] Create app icons in all sizes
- [ ] Design splash screen
- [ ] Prepare Play Store assets:
  - [ ] App icon (512x512)
  - [ ] Feature graphic (1024x500)
  - [ ] Screenshots (min 2)
  - [ ] Privacy policy
  - [ ] App description
- [ ] Create Google Play Developer account
- [ ] Submit to Play Store
- [ ] Monitor crash reports and reviews

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**

- Proper package naming convention
- Internet permission only (minimal permissions)
- HTTPS enforced for production
- Secure Android scheme configuration
- File provider for secure file access
- ProGuard rules for code obfuscation

⚠️ **Recommendations:**

- Create strong keystore password
- Store keystore securely (never in git)
- Use environment variables for sensitive config
- Implement certificate pinning if needed
- Enable Google Play App Signing
- Monitor security advisories

## Known Limitations

1. **Requires Android SDK**: Building APK requires Android SDK and JDK
   installation
2. **Network Dependency**: App requires internet connection (hosted PWA
   approach)
3. **Initial Build**: First build may take longer (Gradle downloads
   dependencies)
4. **Signing Required**: Release builds require manual signing setup

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automate APK builds in GitHub Actions
   - Automated Play Store deployment
   - Automated testing on emulators

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Push notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging
   - Biometric authentication
   - Offline data synchronization
   - Camera and file upload plugins

3. **iOS Support**
   - Add iOS platform with Capacitor
   - Create IPA for App Store
   - Unified iOS/Android configuration

4. **Build Optimizations**
   - App bundle (AAB) instead of APK
   - Dynamic feature modules
   - Asset compression
