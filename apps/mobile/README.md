# Mobile Applications

This directory is reserved for native mobile applications built with React Native or other mobile frameworks.

## Planned Applications

Future native mobile applications will be placed here, separate from PWA-based mobile apps.

## Current Mobile Apps

Currently, mobile applications are built using Capacitor from the PWA applications in `apps/pwa/`:
- Staff admin mobile: Built from `apps/pwa/staff-admin`
- Client mobile: Built from `apps/pwa/client`

## Structure

When native mobile apps are added, they will follow this structure:

```
apps/mobile/
├── staff-native/     # React Native staff app (future)
├── client-native/    # React Native client app (future)
└── README.md
```

## Building Mobile Apps from PWAs

See the individual PWA directories for mobile build instructions:
- Staff admin: `apps/pwa/staff-admin/README.md`
- Client: `apps/pwa/client/README.md`
