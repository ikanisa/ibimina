A mobile application built with Expo and React Native for SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative) services.

## Setup

This app has been configured with all required navigation and UI dependencies:

### Navigation Dependencies
- `@react-navigation/native` - Core navigation library
- `@react-navigation/native-stack` - Native stack navigator
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` - Bottom tab navigator

## Configuration

### Babel Configuration
The `babel.config.js` includes the Reanimated plugin as required:

module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
};
```

### Entry Point
The `index.js` imports `react-native-gesture-handler` first, as required:

```javascript
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import App from './App';
registerRootComponent(App);
```

## Running the App

```bash
# Start Expo development server
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on web
npm run web
```

## Demo Features

The current `App.js` includes a demo that showcases all installed dependencies:
