# AI Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the initial scaffolding implementation for the
AI-powered customer support agent in the Ibimina SACCO platform.

## Implementation Date

October 31, 2025

## Components Delivered

### 1. Backend Package: `@ibimina/ai-agent`

**Location:** `packages/ai-agent/`

**Purpose:** Core AI agent functionality for handling customer support queries
with OpenAI integration.

**Key Files:**

- `package.json` - Package configuration with `openai` dependency
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration extending root config
- `src/index.ts` - Main implementation with AIAgent class
- `tests/ai-agent.test.ts` - Unit tests (4 tests, all passing)
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**API:**

```typescript
class AIAgent {
  constructor(apiKey: string);
  chat(request: ChatRequest): Promise<ChatResponse>;
}

interface Message {
  role: "system" | "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
}

interface ChatRequest {
  messages: Message[];
  model?: string;
  temperature?: number;
}

interface ChatResponse {
  message: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Builds successfully, exports TypeScript declarations, all tests
pass

### 2. Frontend Page: AI Support Chat

**Location:** `apps/admin/app/(main)/dashboard/ai-support/page.tsx`

**Route:** `/dashboard/ai-support`

**Features:**

- Server-side authentication via `requireUserAndProfile()`
- Next.js metadata (title, description)
- Clean layout with header and instructions
- Renders the ChatPanel component

### 3. Chat UI Component

**Location:** `apps/admin/components/ai/chat-panel.tsx`

**Type:** Client-side React component

**Features:**

- Real-time chat interface with message history
- User and assistant message differentiation
- Auto-scrolling to latest messages
- Loading states with animated indicators
- Form submission with Enter key support
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design with dark theme
- Disabled state during API calls

**UI Elements:**

- Message bubbles (blue for user, gray for assistant)
- Timestamps on each message
- Input field with send button
- Loading animation (bouncing dots)

### 4. API Endpoint

**Location:** `apps/admin/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Method:** POST

**Endpoint:** `/api/chat`

**Features:**

- Supabase authentication check (401 if not authenticated)
- Request validation (400 for invalid requests)
- Mocked SACCO-specific responses with keyword matching
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Console logging for debugging

**Mocked Response Topics:**

- `help` - General platform assistance
- `ikimina` - Group creation and management
- `member` - Member operations
- `payment` - Payment processing
- `report` - Report generation

**Future:** Will integrate with `@ibimina/ai-agent` package for actual OpenAI
calls

## Integration Flow

```
User → ChatPanel Component → /api/chat Endpoint → (Future: AI Agent Package) → Response
```

Current flow:

1. User types message in ChatPanel
2. Component calls `/api/chat` via fetch POST
3. API authenticates user via Supabase
4. API validates request
5. API returns mocked response based on keywords
6. Component displays response in chat

Future flow:

1. User types message in ChatPanel
2. Component calls `/api/chat` via fetch POST
3. API authenticates user via Supabase
4. API calls `AIAgent.chat()` from `@ibimina/ai-agent`
5. AI Agent calls OpenAI API with SACCO context
6. Response returned through chain back to user

## Code Quality

### Linting

✅ All files pass ESLint with 0 warnings

### Type Checking

✅ TypeScript compilation successful ✅ Type declarations generated for ai-agent
package ⚠️ Pre-existing errors in `lib/idempotency.ts` (not related to this
implementation)

### Testing

✅ 4 unit tests for AIAgent class, all passing

- Instance creation
- Placeholder response generation
- Empty messages handling
- Multiple messages handling

### Formatting

✅ All code formatted with Prettier

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies

- `openai@^6.3.0` - OpenAI SDK (in ai-agent package)
- `tsx@^4.20.6` - Test runner (dev dependency)

### Existing Dependencies Used

- Next.js 16.0.0
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript 5.9.3
- Supabase SSR & Client

## Known Limitations

1. **Placeholder Responses:** The API currently returns keyword-based mocked
   responses. Full OpenAI integration is planned for future iterations.

2. **Authentication Required:** The page requires valid Supabase credentials.
   With placeholder environment variables, the authentication layer will return
   errors.

3. **No Conversation Persistence:** Messages are stored only in component state.
   Database persistence is planned.

4. **No Context Awareness:** The AI doesn't have access to SACCO-specific data
   or user context yet.

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term

- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API in AIAgent class
- [ ] Add SACCO-specific system prompts
- [ ] Implement conversation history persistence
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### Medium Term

- [ ] Multi-language support (English, Kinyarwanda, French)
- [ ] Integration with SACCO knowledge base
- [ ] Advanced prompt engineering for SACCO operations
- [ ] Function calling for direct system actions
- [ ] Conversation analytics

### Long Term

- [ ] Fine-tuned model for SACCO domain
- [ ] Voice input/output support
- [ ] Proactive assistance based on user actions
- [ ] Integration with notification system

## Testing Instructions

### Unit Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @ibimina/ai-agent test
```

### Build Package

```bash
pnpm --filter @ibimina/ai-agent build
```

### Type Check

```bash
pnpm --filter @ibimina/ai-agent typecheck
```

### Development Server

```bash
pnpm --filter @ibimina/admin dev
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/ai-support

## Deployment Notes

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for production
2. Ensure Supabase credentials are configured
3. The `/dashboard/ai-support` route requires authentication
4. API endpoint `/api/chat` validates authentication on every request

## Security Considerations

✅ Authentication required for both page and API ✅ Input validation on API
endpoint ✅ Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data ✅ API key stored
server-side only ✅ CORS handled by Next.js API routes

## Performance Notes

- Client-side component with minimal re-renders
- API responses are fast (mocked)
- No database queries in current implementation
- Message history stored in memory (component state)

## Documentation

- Package README: `packages/ai-agent/README.md`
- This summary: `packages/ai-agent/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Inline code comments throughout

## Conclusion

The AI agent scaffolding is complete and ready for the next phase: OpenAI
integration. All foundational components are in place, properly typed, tested,
and documented. The architecture supports easy extension and integration with
the actual AI service.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for OpenAI integration phase
