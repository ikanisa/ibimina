   ```bash
   # Stop current application
   pm2 stop all  # or docker-compose down
   
   # Deploy previous version
   git checkout [previous-tag]
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm run build
   
   # Revert database migrations if needed
   supabase migration down --linked --to-version [timestamp]
   
   # Restart application
   pnpm run start  # or docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Verify health check and critical paths
5. Monitor for 30 minutes
