## System Summary

### The Three Apps

1. **Admin/Staff App** (`apps/admin`)
   - **Purpose**: Staff console for SACCO operations
   - **Port**: 3000
   - **Tech**: Next.js 16, Supabase, MFA
   - **Users**: Staff, system administrators
   - **Status**: ✅ Mostly complete, needs auth consolidation

2. **Client App** (`apps/client`)
   - **Purpose**: Member-facing Progressive Web App
   - **Port**: 3001
   - **Tech**: Next.js 15, Supabase, PWA
   - **Users**: SACCO members (general public)
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs OCR implementation, mobile testing

3. **Platform API** (`apps/platform-api`)
   - **Purpose**: Background workers and cron jobs
   - **Port**: N/A (workers)
   - **Tech**: Node.js, TypeScript
   - **Users**: System (automated)
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs worker implementation

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Supabase-Centric**: All apps communicate through Supabase database
2. **Monorepo**: Using pnpm workspaces for shared code
3. **Security**: Different access levels per app (service role vs anon key with
   RLS)
4. **Real-time**: Using Supabase subscriptions for live updates
5. **PWA**: Client app is installable mobile-first PWA

### Critical Gaps to Address

1. **Platform API Workers**: Need implementation (1-2 weeks)
2. **Client OCR Upload**: Need real OCR integration (1 week)
3. **Admin Auth Consolidation**: Remove duplicate auth stacks (3-5 days)
4. **Mobile Testing**: Verify PWA on actual devices (1 week)
5. **Monitoring**: Add cross-app health monitoring (1 week)

### Production Readiness Status

| Area            | Status        | Notes                       |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Admin App Core  | ✅ Ready      | Needs auth cleanup          |
| Client App Core | ⚠️ Partial    | Needs OCR, testing          |
| Platform API    | ❌ Not Ready  | Needs worker implementation |
| Database Schema | ✅ Ready      | RLS policies in place       |
| Authentication  | ⚠️ Partial    | Admin has duplicate stacks  |
| Deployment      | ✅ Documented | See deployment guide        |
| Monitoring      | ⚠️ Partial    | Needs unified dashboard     |
| Documentation   | ✅ Complete   | This documentation set      |

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes to the System

1. **Understand the impact**: Check which apps are affected
2. **Review architecture**: Ensure changes align with architecture
3. **Update multiple apps if needed**: Changes may span admin, client, and
   workers
4. **Test cross-app**: Verify data flows between apps
5. **Update documentation**: Keep these docs in sync

### Adding New Features

1. **Determine app placement**: Which app should own the feature?
2. **Check shared packages**: Can you reuse existing code?
3. **Design API**: How will apps communicate about this feature?
4. **Consider security**: What access level is needed?
5. **Plan deployment**: Will it require database changes?

### Debugging Cross-App Issues

1. **Check health endpoints**: Verify all apps are running
2. **Review database logs**: Check Supabase audit logs
3. **Check real-time subscriptions**: Are updates flowing?
4. **Verify RLS policies**: Could be a permission issue
5. **Check worker health**: Are background jobs running?

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Daily**: Check error logs, monitor worker health
- **Weekly**: Review security alerts, check performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies, review access logs, capacity planning

### When to Update This Documentation

- New app added to the system
- Major architectural change
- New deployment target added
- Security model changes
- New integration points
- Gap is resolved (update gap analysis)
