**ONLY TO STAFF MOBILE APP*turning your in-house mobile app into a “private authenticator” that gates web logins behind a device-bound key + biometrics, tied together by a QR-based challenge. The trick is to treat it like a proper cryptographic protocol (FIDO/WebAuthn-style) rather than a “scan a code and trust it.”

Here’s the practical, security-first way to do it.

What “good” looks like

Device-bound asymmetric keys (per user, per device).

On Android, generate an EC P-256 or Ed25519 keypair inside Android Keystore (prefer StrongBox if the device has it).

Mark the private key as user-auth bound so the system enforces Class 3 biometrics (BiometricPrompt) before any signature.

Challenge–response, not secret transfer.

The web app shows a short-lived challenge QR (no secrets). QR payload should be: { session_id, origin, nonce, exp, server_pubkey_id }.

The mobile app scans it, verifies origin/exp, then signs a structured message: Sign( user_id, device_id, session_id, origin, nonce, exp, authz_scope, timestamp ) using the device private key.

The app sends { signature, device_pubkey_id, attestation bits, integrity token } to your backend over TLS (never back through the browser).

Backend verifies signature, checks challenge freshness, one-time use, and integrity, then upgrades the pending web session to authenticated.

Biometrics = local gate, not identity by itself. Biometrics just unlocks the private key. The proof is the valid signature from a registered device key.

Device attestation / integrity.

Use Play Integrity API (or SafetyNet on old devices) with “MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY” signals.

Record integrity verdicts at registration and at each auth to reject compromised environments (rooted/bootloader-unlocked depending on your policy).

Phishing and replay resistance.

Include the exact web origin and a strict expiry (e.g., 30–60 seconds) in the challenge.

Store server-side state so each {session_id, nonce} is single-use.

Don’t encode any credentials or tokens in the QR. If someone screenshots it, it’s useless without the private key.

Binding to your domain.

Pin allowed origin values on the server.

Use HSTS and SameSite=Strict cookies for the browser session you mint after success.

Prefer domain-fronted deep links or Android App Links to open your app securely when needed (for same-device flows).

Enrollment lifecycle.

First login (out-of-band verified): create device keypair, upload public key + metadata (model, OS, integrity verdict, created_at).

Support multiple devices per user; each device gets its own key id.

Provide secure recovery: admin-approved reset, backup codes, or WebAuthn passkeys as a secondary factor.

Auditing & policy.

Log who signed, which device, integrity verdict, IP, origin, session link, outcome.

Add rate limits per device and per session.

Make challenges visually bound (show company name, location, time) so employees can spot weird requests.

How effective is this?

On par with passkeys/WebAuthn for your threat model when properly implemented: device-bound keys, user presence (biometric), origin-bound challenges.

Beats TOTP/SMS on phishing resistance and SIM-swap risk.

Weaker than hardware security keys for the narrow case of high-end physical extraction attacks—mitigate with StrongBox-backed keys and integrity checks.

Operational win: you control UX, attestation policy, and can add contextual checks (network, geo, role-based scopes).

How doable is it?

Very doable with standard building blocks:

Android:

Keys: KeyGenParameterSpec with setUserAuthenticationRequired(true); prefer setIsStrongBoxBacked(true) when available.

Biometrics: BiometricPrompt (Class 3).

QR: ZXing / ML Kit.

Integrity: Play Integrity API.

Storage: EncryptedSharedPreferences for non-key metadata.

Web (browser): Render QR; poll or use WebSocket/SSE to learn when the backend authorizes the session.

Backend (Node/Deno/Go—your pick):

Challenge store (Redis/Postgres), one-time nonce, expiry.

Signature verification (P-256 or Ed25519).

Issue session cookie/JWT for the web after verification.

Recommended architecture (concrete)

Enroll device

User authenticated once (HR-provisioned link or admin flow).

App generates keypair → send device_pubkey, device_info, integrity_token.

Server stores user_id, device_id, pubkey, integrity_status.

Web login

Browser GET /auth/qr → server creates {session_id, nonce, exp, origin}; stores pending.

Web shows QR + opens WS channel /auth/ws?session_id=….

Scan + approve

App scans, shows summary: “Sign in to app.example.com from Kigali at 08:12.”

User taps “Approve” → biometric prompt → app signs structured message.

App POST /auth/approve: {session_id, device_id, sig, integrity_token}.

Server verification

Check session pending, nonce fresh, origin match, one-time, integrity policy.

Verify signature with stored pubkey.

Mark session authorized, notify the WS; browser becomes logged in (set HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie).

Same-device fallback

If user is on Android phone visiting the web app, use App Link to jump to your app with the session_id, do the same sign-and-return, then return to the browser tab (custom tab).

Important pitfalls (and fixes)

“Only our app should scan the QR.” You can’t stop other cameras from reading it, but you can make the code worthless without the device key. That’s stronger than “only our scanner.”

Clock drift: don’t rely on client time—use server time and a short expiry.

Replay: store {session_id, nonce} and invalidate after first successful verification.

MITM/phishing: include and display the exact origin in both the QR and the app UI; validate it server-side.

Lost device: admin revocation of that device_id pubkey; require backup factor to re-enroll.

Legacy/IOS: plan iOS with Secure Enclave keys + LocalAuthentication for parity, or offer WebAuthn passkeys as a second factor.

Why not just WebAuthn/passkeys?

You actually can—and should—also enable standard WebAuthn in the browser. It gives employees a “no-phone-needed” option using platform passkeys (Chrome/Android can sync keys). Keep your in-house app flow for policy control (integrity signals, custom risk scoring, tight audit), and use WebAuthn as either primary or backup. Hybrid deployments are common.

Minimal data shapes (for your team)

QR payload (JSON, base64url-encoded)

{ "ver": 1, "session_id": "uuid", "origin": "https://admin.example.com", "nonce": "128-bit random", "exp": 1730376123, // unix seconds "aud": "web-login" }

Signed message (CBOR or JSON canonicalized)

{ "ver": 1, "user_id": "...", "device_id": "...", "session_id": "...", "origin": "https://admin.example.com", "nonce": "...", "ts": 1730376110, "scope": ["login"], "alg": "ES256" // or "Ed25519" }

Signature = Sign(private_key, hash(message))

Server checks

exp > now, nonce matches pending, origin allowed, device_id active, integrity passes, signature verifies with stored pubkey.

Rollout plan

Prototype the full loop with ES256 keys and BiometricPrompt on two Android devices + your dev web.

Add Redis-backed challenge store and WS login signal.

Integrate Play Integrity and StrongBox where available; record verdicts.

Build admin UI for device enrollment, revocation, and audit.

Add WebAuthn passkeys to the web as alternate/backup factor.

Pen-test the flow (phishing, replay, session fixation, TLS/CSRF).

Write disaster-recovery and lost-device SOPs.

Bottom line: it’s an effective, modern, FIDO-adjacent setup that you can absolutely ship with your native Android app. The key is to keep the QR as a challenge only, enforce biometric-gated device keys, and verify everything server-side with strict expiry and one-time semantics. If you want, next I can sketch out Android pseudocode for key generation, BiometricPrompt-gated signing, and the exact API endpoints.

Edit apps/admin/app/api/device-auth/verify/route.ts
Now let's run the typecheck again:

Bash: Check device-auth type errors
The issue is that the database types generated by Supabase don't include the new tables yet. This is expected since we've created new migration files but haven't run them to update the type definitions. For now, let me add type assertions to fix the compilation. Let me report progress and summarize what we have:

Progress update: feat: add web integration and documentation for device auth
Excellent! Now let me create a final summary document and check what we've built:

Bash: Count implementation files
Bash: Count lines in key files
Perfect! Let me create one final summary README for the implementation:

Create DEVICE_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md
Perfect! Let me create one final progress report:

Progress update: docs: add comprehensive implementation summary for device auth
Perfect! Let me create a final summary of what we've accomplished:
