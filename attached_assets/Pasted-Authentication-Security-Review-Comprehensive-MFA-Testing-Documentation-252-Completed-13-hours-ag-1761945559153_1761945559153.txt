Completed deep security review of authentication and MFA implementation. Addressed three gaps: unverified API endpoint security controls, undocumented trusted device implementation, and generic error handling without UX guidance.

Changes
Test Coverage (+50 integration tests, all passing)
Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection (12 tests)

User-level (5/5min) and IP-level (10/5min) rate limiting validation
TOTP replay prevention within 60s window
Concurrent request handling and key hashing verification
MFA Challenge State Management (14 tests)

Initiate → verify flow for all factors (TOTP, email, passkey, backup, WhatsApp)
State isolation per user, replay prevention, session fixation prevention
Audit trail generation
Trusted Device Security (24 tests)

Device fingerprinting (userId + userAgentHash + ipPrefix)
Token lifecycle (creation, verification, tampering detection, renewal)
Cookie security (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite) and 30-day TTL enforcement
Example test demonstrating rate limiting validation:

it("enforces IP-level rate limiting for distributed attacks", async () => {
  const hashedIp = "ip-hash-abc123";
  const key = `authx-mfa-ip:${hashedIp}`;
  
  // IP limit: 10 hits per 300 seconds
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const result = await applyRateLimit(key, { maxHits: 10, windowSeconds: 300 });
    assert.equal(result.ok, true);
  }
  
  // 11th request blocked
  const blocked = await applyRateLimit(key, { maxHits: 10, windowSeconds: 300 });
  assert.equal(blocked.ok, false);
});

Gap-by-gap resolution with findings
Complete test results and security scan output (CodeQL: 0 vulnerabilities)
Security Assessment
Validated Controls:

3-layer rate limiting (user/IP/TOTP replay) with hashed keys (no PII leakage)
Device fingerprinting with automatic tamper detection and revocation
Secure session management (HTTP-only cookies, 30-day trusted device TTL)
Comprehensive audit logging for all MFA events
CodeQL Scan: 0 vulnerabilities detected

Notes
Test secrets are hardcoded for isolation and never used in production. See .env.example for production configuration.

Lockfile changes are routine dev tool updates (Wrangler, Vercel, Supabase CLI) from initial pnpm install and don't affect runtime.
