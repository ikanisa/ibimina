**Escalate immediately when**

- A member reports a successful MoMo debit but Atlas shows "pending" for longer
  than 10 minutes.
- Cashiers detect tampered SMS receipts or missing references.
- A reconciliation variance exceeds 30,000 RWF at the sector branch.

**Response steps**

1. Log a ticket under **Finance Controls** with priority **Urgent**.
2. Capture photos of the paper register and attach the MoMo statement line.
3. Notify the branch manager on WhatsApp group `Beta Ops` and record the time of
   escalation.

**Follow-up ownership**

- **Cashier**: Ensures supporting evidence is uploaded within 15 minutes.
- **Branch manager**: Confirms member outreach and approves temporary holds.
- **Core banking liaison**: Checks settlement files and replays failed pushes if
  required.

**Resolution targets**

- Payment mismatches: resolved or refunded within the same business day.
- Fraud suspicion: handover to compliance within 1 hour.
