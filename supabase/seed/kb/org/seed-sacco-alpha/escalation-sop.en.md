**When to escalate**

- Duplicate MoMo receipts for the same reference.
- Ledger mismatch greater than 50,000 RWF after auto-reconciliation.
- Device or Atlas login blocked for more than 15 minutes.

**Immediate actions**

1. Record the ticket in Atlas with type **Operations** and priority **High**.
2. Attach screenshots of SMS receipts or error messages.
3. Call the district escalation line `0788 123 456` if cash is held with the
   field officer.

**Who owns the follow-up**

- **Front office**: Initial triage and documentation.

- **District supervisor**: Confirms resolution and closes the ticket.

**Expected timeline**
