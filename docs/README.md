## Configuration

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are controlled via environment variables with the
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_` prefix:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_WEB_PUSH`: Enable/disable web push notifications
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_BETA_FEATURES`: Enable/disable beta features
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_NEW_UI`: Enable/disable new UI components

See [FEATURE_FLAGS.md](./FEATURE_FLAGS.md) for detailed documentation.

### Service Worker

The application uses a custom service worker for:

- Offline caching
- Background sync
- Push notifications
- Resource optimization

Configuration is in `apps/client/workers/service-worker.ts`.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Application uptime
- API response times
- Error rates
- Push notification delivery rates
- Service worker registration success rate
- Cache hit rates
- User engagement metrics

### Logging

All applications use structured logging. Key log events:

- Authentication events
- API errors
- Push notification events
- Feature flag evaluations

## Security

### Authentication

- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Row-level security (RLS) policies
- Secure HTTP-only cookies

### Web Push Security

- VAPID protocol for server identification
- End-to-end encrypted push messages
- User consent required before subscription

### Content Security Policy

- Strict CSP headers configured
- XSS protection enabled
- Clickjacking protection via X-Frame-Options

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Push Notifications Not Working

1. Verify VAPID keys are correctly configured
2. Check browser console for service worker errors
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for push notifications)
4. Verify user has granted notification permission

#### Service Worker Not Registering

1. Check that app is served over HTTPS (or localhost)
2. Verify service worker file path is correct
3. Check browser console for registration errors
4. Clear browser cache and try again

#### Feature Flags Not Applying

1. Verify environment variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
2. Restart development server after changing .env files
3. Check that FeatureFlagProvider wraps your app
4. Verify flag names match (use kebab-case)
