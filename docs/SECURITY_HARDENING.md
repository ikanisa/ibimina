# Security Hardening Checklist for Production

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28  
**Purpose**: Verify all security measures before production deployment

## Critical Security Configurations

### 1. Secrets Management ‚úÖ

- [ ] All secrets rotated from default/example values
- [ ] Secrets stored in secure secret manager (not in code or .env files)
- [ ] Production secrets never committed to version control
- [ ] Different secrets for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Secrets rotation schedule documented (quarterly minimum)
- [ ] Emergency secret rotation procedure documented

**Verify**:
```bash
# Ensure no secrets in git history
git log --all --full-history -- .env*
# Should return no results

# Check .gitignore includes secrets
grep -E "\.env|secrets|\.pem|\.key" .gitignore
```

### 2. Encryption ‚úÖ

- [ ] KMS_DATA_KEY_BASE64 generated with cryptographic randomness
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- [ ] BACKUP_PEPPER unique and cryptographically secure
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
- [ ] Field-level encryption active for PII:
  - [ ] MSISDN (phone numbers)
  - [ ] National ID numbers
  - [ ] Other sensitive personal data
- [ ] Encryption keys stored securely (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or similar)
- [ ] Database encrypted at rest (Supabase default)
- [ ] Backups encrypted
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced for all connections

**Verify**:
```sql
-- Check that sensitive fields are encrypted (appear as ciphertext)
SELECT msisdn, national_id FROM members LIMIT 5;
-- Should show encrypted values, not plaintext

-- Verify hash columns exist for lookups
SELECT msisdn_hash, national_id_hash FROM members LIMIT 5;
-- Should show hash values
```

### 3. Authentication & Authorization üîê

- [ ] MFA enforced for all admin users
- [ ] MFA encouraged/required for staff users
- [ ] Password minimum length: 12 characters
- [ ] Password complexity requirements enabled
- [ ] Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- [ ] Session timeout: 12 hours maximum (MFA_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS)
- [ ] Trusted device tokens expire after 30 days (TRUSTED_DEVICE_TTL_SECONDS)
- [ ] Break-glass MFA reset procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Service accounts follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] No shared accounts (each user has unique credentials)

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check MFA configuration
echo $MFA_SESSION_SECRET | wc -c  # Should be 64 (32 bytes hex = 64 chars)
echo $MFA_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS  # Should be 43200 (12 hours)
echo $TRUSTED_DEVICE_TTL_SECONDS  # Should be 2592000 (30 days)

# Verify MFA RP configuration matches domain
echo $MFA_RP_ID  # Should be your-domain.com
echo $MFA_ORIGIN  # Should be https://your-domain.com
```

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS) üõ°Ô∏è

- [ ] RLS enabled on all tables
- [ ] RLS policies tested comprehensively: `pnpm run test:rls`
- [ ] Staff users can only access assigned SACCOs
- [ ] Admin users have appropriate elevated permissions
- [ ] System accounts have service-role access only where needed
- [ ] No bypass policies in production
- [ ] Anonymous access disabled or severely restricted

**Verify**:
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND rowsecurity = false;
-- Should return no results

-- Check policy count per table
SELECT schemaname, tablename, COUNT(policyname) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY schemaname, tablename
ORDER BY policy_count;
-- All tables should have policies
```

### 5. Network Security üåê

- [ ] HTTPS enforced (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ only (TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled)
- [ ] HSTS enabled with appropriate max-age

  - [ ] Infrastructure level (CloudFlare, AWS WAF, etc.)

**Verify**:
```bash
# Test HTTPS enforcement
curl -I http://your-domain.com
# Should return 301/302 redirect to https://

# Check SSL configuration
echo | openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
# Should show valid dates

# Test TLS version
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 your-domain.com

# Should output all required headers
```

**Expected headers**:
```
