# SACCO+ Row Level Security

Row Level Security is enabled on all `app` tables plus the operational helpers that accept writes from Edge Functions. Policies lean on helper functions defined in `supabase/migrations/20251012120000_sacco_plus_schema.sql`:

- `app.current_sacco()` – current user’s SACCO from `app.user_profiles`.
- `app.current_role()` – role (`SYSTEM_ADMIN`, `SACCO_MANAGER`, `SACCO_STAFF`).
- `app.is_admin()` – `true` if the JWT or profile role is `SYSTEM_ADMIN`.
- `app.payment_sacco(payment_id)` / `app.account_sacco(account_id)` – derive SACCO for dependent records.

## Policy matrix

| Table | Select | Insert | Update/Delete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `app.user_profiles` | user sees own row; admins see all | admins only | admins only |
| `app.saccos` | staff: own SACCO; admins: all | admins only | admins only |
| `app.ikimina` | staff: same SACCO; admins: all | staff within SACCO, admins all | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.members` | staff: same SACCO; admins: all | staff within SACCO, admins all | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.payments` | staff: same SACCO; admins: all | staff within SACCO, admins all | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.recon_exceptions` | staff: via payment SACCO; admins: all | system/service role | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.accounts` | staff: SACCO-linked accounts; admins: all | admins only | admins only |
| `app.ledger_entries` | staff: SACCO-linked entries; admins: all | admins only | admins only |
| `app.sms_inbox` | staff: same SACCO; admins: all | service role (Edge Functions) | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.import_files` | staff: same SACCO; admins: all | staff within SACCO, admins all | staff within SACCO, admins all |
| `app.audit_logs` | actor sees own entries; admins: all | open insert policy for system/service role | n/a (reads only) |
| `app.devices_trusted` | owner or admin | owner/admin | owner/admin |
| `ops.rate_limits` | admins only | admins only | admins only |
| `ops.idempotency` | owner or admin | owner or admin | owner or admin |

The Supabase service-role key used inside Edge Functions bypasses RLS; every function enforces SACCO scope before writing with the elevated client.

## JWT expectations

- Staff JWTs include `app_metadata.role`. If absent the role falls back to `app.user_profiles.role`.
- System administrators receive `SYSTEM_ADMIN`; they bypass SACCO filters.
- Edge Functions parsing staff JWTs must forward the bearer token when re-calling Supabase APIs that should respect RLS (UI clients do this automatically).

## Examples

- A SACCO staff member posting to `/payments/apply` must specify their own `saccoId`. The function rejects mismatched SACCOs even though it uses the service role internally.
- `/recon/exceptions` GET filters by `payment.sacco_id`, so staff only see exceptions for their SACCO; admins get the full dataset.
- `/admin/reset-mfa` is restricted to `SYSTEM_ADMIN` via JWT + profile check before any MFA data is mutated.

Keep this file updated whenever policies change to ensure auditors can trace authorisation paths quickly.

## Local testing harness

The RLS test suite (`pnpm run test:rls` from `apps/admin`) now mirrors Supabase more closely:

- `infra/docker/docker-compose.rls.yml` runs `supabase/postgres:15.1.1.71`, which ships the same extensions (`pg_net`, `pgcrypto`, etc.) as production instances. Start it with `docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.rls.yml up -d postgres` before running tests.
- `supabase/tests/fixtures/bootstrap.sql` provisions the minimal `auth`, `storage`, `extensions`, and helper schemas that migrations expect. It also exposes `auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()`, and the new `auth.role()` so policies behave the same as on Supabase.
- When `pg_net` cannot be installed (common on CI), the remote-schema migrations stub `net.http_post()` inside a guarded `DO $$` block, allowing migrations to complete while still exercising the code paths that call `net.http_post`.
- Each RLS test sets `set_config(..., false)` to pin JWT claims for the session and targets `app.*` tables directly, so results aren’t dependent on privileged `public.*` view owners.

If the harness fails with “connection refused,” ensure the docker container is running and that nothing else is bound to port `6543`.
