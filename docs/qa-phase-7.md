# Phase 7 â€“ QA & Launch Readiness Results

This log captures the current QA status for the Ibimina Staff PWA. It supplements the checklist in `docs/qa-launch-checklist.md`.

## 1. Performance Snapshot
- âœ… `npm run build` (Next 15) â€” First Load JS 102 kB, per-route bundle sizes captured in build output (see `npm run build` logs for detailed table).
- ðŸš§ `npm run check:lighthouse` â€” **blocked in this environment** (`npm` cannot reach registry to download Lighthouse). Run locally with network access: `npm install --global lighthouse` (or `npx lighthouse`) then `npm run dev` + `npm run check:lighthouse`.
- Recommendation: capture mobile Lighthouse scores (Performance â‰¥ 90) and attach HTML report during release prep.

## 2. Accessibility & i18n
- âœ… Manual spot-check: pages render bilingual labels (`BilingualText`), toast provider exposes `aria-live` announcements, recon/preview screens keep keyboard focus outlines.
- ðŸš§ Automated axe run pending â€” install `@axe-core/cli` (requires network) and execute `npx @axe-core/cli http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
- Follow-up: document any violations, update tokens/translations in `locales/` as needed.

## 3. Regression Path
- âœ… Build + lint pass (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`).
- ðŸš§ Full CSV â†’ Recon â†’ Report to be exercised against staging data once Supabase migrations are applied. Steps:
  1. `npm run dev`
  2. Import sample member & statement files via Ikimina workflows (confirm parser feedback).
  3. Resolve reconciliation exceptions using the new hints/member search, note audit entries.
  4. Generate PDF/CSV exports from Reports preview and verify branding text.

## 4. Notification Queue Smoke Test
- âœ… Admin panel now surfaces the latest 20 events (queued reminder + SMS test). To verify end-to-end delivery, ensure backend processors consume `notification_queue` and inspect results inside Supabase logs.

## 5. Outstanding Tasks Before Release
1. Run Lighthouse (mobile/desktop) & attach reports.
2. Execute automated axe scan and record outcomes.
3. Capture screenshots / metrics for the end-to-end regression scenario and archive them in release notes.
