# Ibimina Production Go-Live Audit

## Executive summary
- **Overall readiness**: security, UX, and observability gaps identified in Phases P0–P3 have been closed, leaving a focused backlog of performance, data, and QA work before a Vercel go-live. Runtime configuration and infrastructure automation are documented, and environment validation now fails closed when secrets are missing.
- **Strengths**: layered providers centralise theming, offline, PWA, and Supabase session syncing, giving the React tree a predictable runtime context for both RSC and client features.【F:providers/app-providers.tsx†L1-L35】 Server middleware enforces a robust security header set and propagates CSP nonces through to the layout, keeping inline scripts compliant with a strict policy.【F:app/layout.tsx†L1-L38】【F:middleware.ts†L1-L41】 Operational scripts exist for RLS regression testing and Supabase migrations, and the service worker already differentiates immutable caches, API requests, and auth-scoped background sync.【F:scripts/test-rls.sh†L1-L16】【F:scripts/db-reset.sh†L1-L19】【F:service-worker.js†L1-L221】
- **Key gaps**: dashboard and analytics caches now refresh automatically from Supabase materialised views; focus shifts to validating refresh frequency under production load and expanding analytics drill-down coverage before launch. Log drain alerting and MFA automation are enforced in CI, closing the previous operational blockers.【F:lib/dashboard.ts†L1-L206】【F:supabase/migrations/20251011153000_dashboard_materialization.sql†L1-L173】【F:app/api/cache/revalidate/route.ts†L1-L70】【F:tests/e2e/auth.mfa.spec.ts†L1-L93】

## Full-stack code review findings

### Security & platform
- **Cryptographically strong nonces**: `createNonce` now requires secure randomness via `crypto.getRandomValues` or `crypto.randomUUID`, guaranteeing CSP entropy across Node, Edge, and browser runtimes with exhaustive unit coverage.【F:lib/security/headers.ts†L63-L109】
- **Deterministic request IDs**: Middleware emits secure UUIDs whenever clients omit `x-request-id`, ensuring traceability for structured logging and downstream drains without relying on low-entropy fallbacks.【F:middleware.ts†L1-L45】
- **Offline auth scope hashing**: Auth scope updates abort if hashing fails, so legacy browsers never persist raw Supabase credentials; background sync resets caches instead of risking credential leakage.【F:lib/offline/sync.ts†L1-L94】【F:service-worker.js†L107-L205】
- **Service worker versioning**: Cache namespaces incorporate the injected build identifier, automatically invalidating stale bundles during each Vercel deployment without manual version bumps.【F:service-worker.js†L1-L76】【F:next.config.ts†L1-L74】

### Backend & Supabase integration
- **Session callback health**: `/auth/callback` emits structured logs, validates payloads, and fails closed when Supabase credentials are absent, avoiding silent cookie hydration failures during cold starts.【F:app/auth/callback/route.ts†L1-L88】【F:lib/supabase/config.ts†L1-L70】
- **Database test harness**: Docker Compose-driven RLS tests mirror CI defaults, eliminating bespoke Postgres setup and letting preview environments reuse the same fixtures.【F:infra/docker/docker-compose.rls.yml†L1-L24】【F:scripts/test-rls-docker.sh†L1-L21】
- **Runtime config surfacing**: Supabase client factories log detailed misconfiguration context before throwing, guiding operators toward missing Vercel secrets or environment drift.【F:lib/supabase/config.ts†L1-L70】【F:lib/supabase/server.ts†L1-L33】

### Frontend & UX
- **Locale alignment**: Server-side negotiation keeps `<html lang>` and the initial `I18nProvider` language in sync so assistive technology reads the correct locale on first paint.【F:app/layout.tsx†L1-L60】【F:lib/i18n/resolve-locale.ts†L1-L53】
- **Navigation contrast & scaling**: Primary navigation now uses sentence-case typography, AA-compliant color tokens, and enlarged touch targets, preserving readability on compact breakpoints.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L55-L181】
- **Search affordance**: Quick actions expose shortcut hints, focus outlines, and roving tabindex handling, making global search discoverable to both keyboard and pointer users.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L200-L316】

### Performance & build tooling
- **Bundle governance**: GitHub Actions now enforces manifest-driven bundle budgets via `assert-bundle-budgets`, failing builds that exceed the SACCO+ thresholds before merge.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L43-L104】【F:scripts/assert-bundle-budgets.mjs†L1-L104】
- **Image domains**: `next.config.ts` documents approved remote patterns and exposes environment-specific toggles for Supabase storage providers, keeping asset requests within the CSP allowlist.【F:next.config.ts†L1-L109】【F:README.md†L60-L118】

### Testing & QA
- **Automated coverage**: Playwright smoke tests with stubbed Supabase sessions validate login flows, dashboard metrics, and offline recovery as part of CI so PWA regressions surface before deploys.【F:tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts†L1-L72】【F:playwright.config.ts†L1-L46】

## UI/UX system audit
- **Bilingual experience**: Localised navigation now defaults to sentence case, and locale dictionaries hydrate on first paint so magnifiers and screen readers respect the selected language.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L55-L181】【F:lib/i18n/locales.ts†L1-L65】
- **Focus management**: Quick actions exposes visible focus states, roving tabindex controls, and Escape handling to satisfy WCAG 2.4.7 for keyboard-only users.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L200-L316】
- **Offline affordances**: The offline indicator surfaces background sync reasons, queue counts, and manual retry actions while the offline route provides branded recovery guidance.【F:components/system/offline-queue-indicator.tsx†L1-L126】【F:app/offline/page.tsx†L1-L52】

## Phased implementation roadmap
1. **Phase 2 – Performance & data (Week 1)**
   - Materialise dashboard + analytics views in Supabase and swap server code to consume them.
   - Add Supabase trigger/webhook-driven cache invalidation for executive analytics and dashboard tags.
   - Extend RLS regression suite for payments, reconciliation exceptions, and operational tables.
2. **Phase 3 – Operations & QA (Week 2)**
   - Assert log drain delivery in CI (synthetic POST) and integrate alert routing with the new drain metadata.
   - Promote MFA factor unit tests and Playwright flows (including rate limit/replay guards) into the required pipeline.
   - Rehearse preview → production deploy with postdeploy verification scripting once monitoring gates pass.

## Next steps checklist
- [x] Ship Supabase materialised views for dashboard + analytics and update `lib/dashboard.ts`/`lib/analytics.ts` consumers.
- [x] Add Supabase trigger/webhook hooks that call `revalidateTag` for dashboard + analytics cache tags after imports.
- [x] Extend RLS regression SQL suites to payments, reconciliation exceptions, and ops tables; gate via CI.
- [x] Add synthetic log drain delivery checks to CI and wire alerting for drain failures.
- [x] Implement MFA factor unit tests and Playwright coverage for replay/rate-limit paths before enabling deploy approvals.

## Phase 1 implementation updates
- **Locale negotiation** now reads the persisted cookie and `Accept-Language` header to align `<html lang>` with the initial `I18nProvider` value, preventing assistive-technology mismatches during server rendering.【F:app/layout.tsx†L1-L45】【F:providers/app-providers.tsx†L1-L32】【F:providers/i18n-provider.tsx†L1-L84】【F:lib/i18n/resolve-locale.ts†L1-L45】
- **Service worker cache busting** derives cache keys from the build identifier exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`, eliminating manual version bumps ahead of Vercel deployments.【F:service-worker.js†L1-L15】【F:next.config.ts†L1-L109】
- **RLS regression automation** ships a Docker Compose harness and wrapper script so developers and CI can launch the Postgres fixture container with `pnpm test:rls:docker`, matching the GitHub Actions setup.【F:infra/docker/docker-compose.rls.yml†L1-L24】【F:scripts/test-rls-docker.sh†L1-L19】【F:package.json†L11-L24】

## Phase 2 implementation updates
- **Navigation typography** switches from all-caps microcopy to responsive sentence-case labels with wider hit targets on mobile, improving AA readability while keeping icon badges accessible.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L73-L157】【F:components/system/offline-queue-indicator.tsx†L27-L107】
- **Quality gates in CI** now fail the pipeline if the production bundle exceeds 480KB of initial JS or if the dashboard chunk regresses, and Lighthouse continues to assert performance budgets.【F:scripts/assert-bundle-budgets.mjs†L1-L103】【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L104】
- **Playwright smoke coverage** spins up the production build with a stub Supabase session to exercise login ergonomics, dashboard rendering, and the offline queue indicator before deploys.【F:playwright.config.ts†L1-L40】【F:tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts†L1-L56】【F:app/api/__e2e/session/route.ts†L1-L49】【F:lib/auth.ts†L1-L86】

## Phase 3 implementation updates
- **Structured log drain forwarding** now ships with the core logger, enriching each event with request/user context, environment metadata, and optional drain source tags while streaming JSON payloads to `LOG_DRAIN_URL` with guard timeouts.【F:lib/observability/logger.ts†L16-L125】
- **Operations runbook** documents how to provision the log drain, exercise the new unit tests, and coordinate preview deploy secrets so on-call engineers have a single source of truth during incidents.【F:docs/operations-runbook.md†L1-L53】
- **Unit coverage** ensures the logger emits correct headers, context fields, and failure handling when the drain is enabled, blocking regressions before release rehearsals.【F:tests/unit/logger.test.ts†L1-L115】
