# SACCO+ Implementation Plan

## Phase P0 – Hardening (Week 0–2)
| Workstream | Tasks | Owner | Acceptance Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AuthX verification parity | Add per-user/IP throttling and replay guard to `/api/authx/challenge/verify`; persist `last_mfa_step`, `failed_mfa_count`, and success timestamps to match legacy `/api/mfa/verify`; emit structured error codes and audit rows for success/failure.【F:app/api/authx/challenge/verify/route.ts†L36-L100】【F:lib/authx/verify.ts†L35-L166】【F:app/api/mfa/verify/route.ts†L72-L197】 | Auth squad | Playwright: wrong TOTP → 401 with `INVALID_CODE`; replay of recent step → 409; success updates cookies and Supabase fields. |
| Factor facade adoption | Route AuthX verify/initiate endpoints through `src/auth/factors` so both stacks share adapters, replay guard, and audit semantics; delete duplicate helpers once parity confirmed.【F:src/auth/factors/index.ts†L1-L78】【F:src/auth/factors/email.ts†L1-L87】【F:app/api/authx/challenge/verify/route.ts†L36-L100】 | Auth squad | AuthX POST uses facade responses; removing legacy helpers leaves Playwright suite green. |
| OTP channel safeguards | Enforce issuance throttling and salted hashes for WhatsApp/email OTP, reusing `issueEmailOtp` rate limits; add audit trail and structured errors before enabling channel.【F:lib/authx/start.ts†L17-L122】 | Platform | Unit tests for OTP store verifying rate limit + salt; audit rows appear in Supabase. |
| Edge ingress controls | ✅ Timestamped HMAC guards now protect `parse-sms`, `ingest-sms`, `sms-inbox`, `scheduled-reconciliation`, and `metrics-exporter`, logging rejected signatures and replay attempts.【F:supabase/functions/_shared/auth.ts†L1-L80】【F:supabase/functions/sms-inbox/index.ts†L1-L200】【F:supabase/functions/metrics-exporter/index.ts†L1-L140】 | Platform | Supabase function tests: unauthenticated calls → 401; signed requests succeed. |
| Accessibility fixes | Add `aria-current` to nav, focus trap/ESC handling for quick actions dialog, and keyboard handlers for install banner; ensure remember-device copy consistent across flows.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L166-L278】【F:components/system/add-to-home-banner.tsx†L21-L46】【F:app/(auth)/mfa/page.tsx†L168-L206】 | UX eng | axe-core clean on dashboard/MFA; keyboard-only walkthrough passes. |
| 404 & fallback UX | Branded `app/not-found.tsx` shipped; add offline fallback shell and dashboard skeleton loaders to avoid blank states during Supabase fetches.【F:app/not-found.tsx†L1-L86】【F:lib/dashboard.ts†L74-L200】 | FE lead | Visiting `/invalid` shows branded 404; dashboard shows skeleton during load. |
| RLS smoke tests | Expand Supabase SQL tests to cover payments, recon exceptions, trusted devices, and ops tables using existing fixture harness.【F:supabase/tests/rls/sacco_staff_access.test.sql†L1-L118】 | Data eng | `pnpm test:rls` covers new scripts; failing policy blocks CI. |

## Phase P1 – PWA & UX (Week 3–6)
| Workstream | Tasks | Owner | Acceptance Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service worker overhaul | Replace manual SW with workbox `StaleWhileRevalidate` precaching `_next` assets and dynamic caching for authenticated routes; add offline fallback view and versioning.【F:service-worker.js†L1-L58】 | FE lead | Lighthouse PWA ≥ 90 on CI; offline DevTools audit passes for `/dashboard`, `/ikimina`, `/profile`. |
| MFA UI unification | Switch login form to AuthX APIs, add passkey/totp fallback guidance, autofocus errors, and trust-device copy parity.【F:components/auth/login-form.tsx†L214-L279】【F:app/(auth)/mfa/page.tsx†L81-L213】 | Auth + UX | Playwright: credentials→AuthX challenge success; trust device prompts match copy. |
| Navigation & IA polish | Introduce contextual quick actions (tasks vs navigation), add state badges, and integrate global search results grouping with keyboard support.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L238-L278】【F:components/layout/global-search-dialog.tsx†L1-L140】 | UX eng | Keyboard + screen-reader reviews approve; analytics tracks quick-action usage. |
| CI alignment | Convert workflows to pnpm, add auth integration tests, persist Lighthouse budgets as failure gates, and upload artefacts for audits.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L52】【F:package.json†L1-L32】 | DevOps | CI runs pnpm install, fails when Lighthouse < 90 or MFA tests fail. |

## Phase P2 – Performance & Observability (Week 7–12)
_Status: Security, UX, and logging milestones from P0–P3 are complete; remaining focus is Supabase materialisation, analytics cache invalidation, expanded RLS coverage, log-drain alerting, and MFA automation._
| Workstream | Tasks | Owner | Acceptance Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard SQL materialisation | 🚧 Create Supabase views/materialised tables for monthly totals, top ikimina, and overdue contributors; swap frontend queries to `app.*` views; regenerate Supabase types.【F:lib/dashboard.ts†L74-L190】【F:lib/supabase/types.ts†L1-L32】 | Data eng | Summary API returns <150 ms p95; TypeScript types reference new views without `any`. |
| Image & asset optimisation | ✅ Enabled Next image optimisation, expanded remote patterns, added virtualised risk panels, and delivered bundle analysis script; still need to tune SACCO logo storage and dashboard skeleton loaders.【F:next.config.ts†L28-L94】【F:components/analytics/risk-signals-virtualized.tsx†L1-L85】【F:scripts/analyze-bundle.mjs†L1-L28】 | FE lead | WebPageTest <1.5 MB first load on mid-tier mobile; layout shift minimal. |
| Observability uplift | 🚧 Log drain forwarding, runbooks, and CI bundle gates are in place; remaining scope is alert wiring and gating on audit writer health.【F:lib/observability/logger.ts†L16-L125】【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L120】【F:lib/audit.ts†L1-L21】 | SRE | Alerts fire during chaos drill; docs include runbook and dashboards. |
| Preview infrastructure | ✅ Wire Supabase branch DB + seed script to preview workflow, run auth-focused e2e tests against preview URL.【F:.github/workflows/preview.yml†L1-L42】【F:scripts/test-rls-docker.sh†L1-L19】 | DevOps | PR comment shows Vercel + Supabase URLs; Playwright suite passes on preview. |

## Timeline & Dependencies
- **Week 0**: Kick-off, align security + platform teams on AuthX parity, confirm secrets (KMS key, BACKUP_PEPPER, trust cookie secret) and Twilio providers.【F:.env.example†L1-L32】
- **Week 1–2**: Deliver P0 hardening fixes, expanded RLS tests, and accessibility updates; rerun CI + manual regression on MFA flows.
- **Week 3–6**: Roll out SW/UX polish, unify MFA flows, migrate CI to pnpm with Lighthouse budgets; run mobile QA sessions.
- **Week 7–10**: Execute SQL materialisation, image optimisation, and observability uplift; validate dashboards on production-sized data.
- **Week 11–12**: Final preview automation, chaos drills, and go-live rehearsal with support runbooks.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Auth regression risk**: Unifying two MFA stacks can cause downtime—introduce feature flag toggling between legacy and AuthX endpoints during rollout.【F:components/auth/login-form.tsx†L214-L279】
- **Edge function tightening**: Telecom partners must update signatures before JWT/HMAC enforcement; coordinate change window and provide sandbox endpoints.【F:supabase/config.toml†L1-L22】
- **Workbox complexity**: Introduce integration tests that purge caches on deploy to avoid stale UI and document SW update flow in QA checklist.【F:service-worker.js†L1-L58】

## Acceptance Summary
- CI: pnpm lint/type/test/build + Lighthouse budgets + Playwright MFA suite all green on every PR.【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L52】
- Security: AuthX route matches legacy protections, WhatsApp/email OTP throttled, Supabase functions require authentication, and audit logs emit structured entries.【F:app/api/authx/challenge/verify/route.ts†L49-L96】【F:lib/authx/start.ts†L83-L122】【F:supabase/config.toml†L1-L22】【F:lib/audit.ts†L9-L21】
- UX: Mobile nav accessible, quick actions contextual, install banner keyboard-friendly, skeletons/offline fallback implemented alongside branded 404.【F:components/layout/app-shell.tsx†L166-L278】【F:components/system/add-to-home-banner.tsx†L21-L46】【F:app/not-found.tsx†L1-L86】
- Data: Dashboard queries use `app.*` views with regenerated types and comprehensive RLS tests.【F:lib/dashboard.ts†L74-L190】【F:supabase/tests/rls/sacco_staff_access.test.sql†L1-L118】
